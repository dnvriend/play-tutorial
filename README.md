Playframework-tutorial
======================
This is a study project on how to use the play framework. It uses branches to switch the focus from one subject to another.
It basically covers the playframework documentation and shows the basics. I would advice (I have done so) getting the following
books (I don't get any money from Manning or Typesafe) and study them:

* [Play for Scala](http://typesafe.com/resources/e-book/play-for-scala)
* [Reactive Web Applications with Play](http://info.typesafe.com/EBK-20XX-Reactive-Web-Applications-with-Play_L.html?lst=PPS&lsd=EBK-20XX-Reactive-Web-Applications-with-Play)

Have fun!
